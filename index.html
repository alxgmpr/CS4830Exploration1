                    <h5 class="right-align">Previously</h5>
                    <p>My affinity for web development started by picking up HTML and CSS books at the library. At that point, viewing a web page's source was enough for me. But this taste grew as I got older and I found myself intrigued with how our Internet is built upon.</p>
                    <p>This meant I was playing with scripting languages whenever possible. I installed a LAMP server on my depressingly antiquated Gateway tower so that I could simulate client-server interaction.</p>
                    <p>As I got older I started to build more feature filled websites. I gained experience with CMS' like Wordpress and Joomla, enjoying playing with their source code. These CMS are what introduced me to PHP and server-side programming.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>Today, I'm experienced in not only web scripting languages, but object-oriented ones as well, such as Java, C, and Python. I still deeply love web development, and now enjoy working with PHP and MySQL for personal projects.</p>
                    <div class="divider"></div>
                    <p>When I was 18, I founded my own company, Fused Claptons LLC, in my dorm room at Mizzou (freshman year). I specialized in building incredibly intricate heating elements for e-cigarette vaporizers.</p>
                    <p>The now-defunct company saw good growth over it's 6 active months. I developed recurring wholesale relationships with vendors overseas while also handling product manufacture, packaging, and shipping distribution from my bedroom.</p>
                    <p>I also built the e-commerce backend with Wordpress and Shopify, gaining valuable experience not only by uniting the two, but also with credit card merchant processing and payment handling.</p>
                    <p>For me, this project was great because I culminated almost all of my web design knowledge into something that had more purpose than dummy LAMP servers on my old desktop. I even designed the logo myself using my web forum knowledge and the Adobe Creative Suite.</p>

                    <h5 class="right-align">Currently</h5>
                    <p>Although my company is no longer active or functional, I occupy my time studying computer science whilst buying, selling, and collecting rare sneakers and clothes. To most it sounds understandably odd, but the hobby is a large part of me now.</p>
                    <p>My Sophomore year of high school I gained an interest in the skateshop and streetwear brand Supreme. From that interest I made a habit of buying and selling the brand's rare and valued hats. These were bought and sold mainly through eBay, which gave me valuable experience that I use today.</p>
                    <p>Today, my personal programming projects include applications designed to help me acquire popular sneakers quickly and at low costs. These (unfinished!) projects and tools are available on my Github.</p>

                    <p>My current sneaker and Supreme inventory is listed on a multitude of websites and marketplaces.</p>
                    <p>I reccomend using the contact form if you are interested in purchasing anything listed. As always, reasonable offers will be considred.</p>
